The goal of this project is to write a Spark program to compute the clustering coefficient of every node of a graph. The four different phases of the project, their expected subgoals, and their submission deadlines are as follows. A small graph, called TinyDataSet, is included at the end of this description. A somewhat larger test graph, called SmallDataSet, will be made available before the due date.

1.	Phase-1: Write a program for Spark (in PySpark, Scala, or Spark-JAVA) that takes as input a list of edges of a graph, and outputs a node-list representation of the graph. In the output, for each node (=key) the value is a list of all the nodes to which the key node is connected.
a.	Items to be submitted: (i) your program source code, (ii) A list of input records used by your program, (iii) Output of your program for the TinyDataSet, (iv) Output of your program for the SmallDataSet.
b.	Due Date: March 23rd, 2020, 9PM.
2.	Phase-2: Write a program for Spark (in PySpark, Scala, or Spark-JAVA) that takes as input a graph in the list representation (generated in phase-1 above) and produces a list of records such that the key is a node number and the value is the 2-hop projection of the node in the graph.
a.	Items to be submitted: (i) your program source code, (ii) Output of your program for the graph representation generated in Phase-2 for the TinyDataSet, (iii) Output of your program for the output generated by Phase-1 for the SmallDataSet.
b.	Due Date: March 26th, 2020, 9PM.
3.	Phase-3: Write a program for Spark (in PySpark, Scala, or Spark-JAVA) that takes as input a graph in the form of 2-hop projection (value) for each node (key) and produces a list of (key, value) pairs such that for each node (key), the value is all the triangles incident on that node.
a.	Items to be submitted: (i) yourprogram source code, (ii) Output of your program for the graph of TinyDataSet, and (ii) Output of your program for the graph of SmallDataSet.
